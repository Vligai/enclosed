Alpha Report 
	

Our Alpha system consists of  a database, server and a client. The server and a client communicate using sockets, SSL will be implemented later in the development (Beta system). The client is used by running command line arguments which are parsed by the server.



Building and running: 

First of all type in 'make re' in order to apply any changes made since last time program was run. 

To launch server simply type in './server ' + your desired port number. 

To launch client type in './client ' + host name + port number of the server.  



How client and server work: 

After a successful establishment of connection the user will be asked for a user name and a password. The information provided by the user will be sent to a server to be reviewed/compared to the one saved in the database. Users will be given a set of commands he/she can input, which could be viewed anytime using '/help' command. The user then inputs valid commands that the server will check and run. If the command does not exist the server will warn the user that the command is invalid. 


How Database works:
Database.c is able to save, retrieve and delete usernames and passwords from the database. It will be connected with client and server in the Beta system.

Security features implemented:

We have implemented MD5 hashes to our passwords to initialized our security protocol. During the development of our password manager we will improve the security of our system by implementing AES-128.
